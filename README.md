# Mask Detection System

##Motivation
This system has been developed, keeping in mind, the current pandemic situation. In order to detect if a person entering any building has put his/her mask on, 
an efficient system needs to be designed, where it can detect and raise an alarm, in real time, if a person is not wearing a mask.
